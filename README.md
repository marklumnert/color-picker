Color Picker is handy extension that let you easily search for your desired color via an stylish popup.

In the middle, there is a big icon (color-palette icon) which can be used to render the native color picker UI. Click on this icon in order to pick a new color. Please note that, depending on your browser and OS, the native color picker UI may vary significantly. Once you chose a color, the table on the right-side will be updated with color values in six different formats. For the first time when you open the color picker UI, please click on the "Basic colors" section once, otherwise the addon will not be able to select and save your color. At the bottom of the UI, you will see a table with all the selected colors in solid-circles. If you click on a circle, the current color will change to the selected circle color. Moreover, if you want to delete all circles, pleased press on the - Clear History - button at the top toolbar.
